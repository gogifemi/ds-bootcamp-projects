# DS Bootcamp Projects Repository  
__Welcome! 👋 This repository contains the projects I completed during my Data Science and AI Bootcamp. It showcases my progress and skills in various areas of data science, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning and data visualization.__     

## 🚧 Work in Progress  
This repository is currently a work in progress as I continue to refine the projects and enhance the documentation to provide more context and insights into the work done. __Although I'm currently attending a full-time German language course, updates will be added regularly!__  

## 🗂️ Repository Overview  
The projects in this repository cover a range of data science topics, including:  
- __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ Techniques and visualizations to uncover insights from raw data.  
- __Machine Learning:__ Models developed and evaluated for predictive tasks.  
- __Data Visualization:__ Use of Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create meaningful visualizations.  
- __Other Data Science Concepts:__ Additional tools and methods applied during the bootcamp.  

## 📋 What's Inside  
Each project folder contains:   
- Jupyter notebooks with __step-by-step analysis__ and code.  
- Visualizations and results derived from the analysis.  

## 🌱 Goals for the Repository  
- Showcase the skills and techniques I acquired during the bootcamp.  
- Provide insights into the data science process and workflows.  
- Continuously improve and expand the repository as I learn and grow.
